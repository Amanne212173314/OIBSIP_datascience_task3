# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning 🚗💰

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model to predict car prices** based on various features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurately predicting car prices helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions. In this project, we:
- Analyze a car dataset
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
- Train machine learning models to predict car prices
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

The project is implemented using **Python** and popular **machine learning libraries**.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of cars, such as:
- Car name / Brand
- Year of manufacture
- Selling price
- Present price
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Number of owners

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed for model training.

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Import Required Libraries**
2. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature selection
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
   - Other regression models (if included)
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Price distribution plots
- Correlation heatmap
- Actual vs Predicted price comparison

These visualizations help in understanding data relationships and model performance.

---

## ✅ Results

- The trained model is able to predict car prices with **good accuracy**.
- Evaluation metrics indicate reasonable performance for real-world usage.
