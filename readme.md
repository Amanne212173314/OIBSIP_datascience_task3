## 📌 Project Overview

Accurately predicting car prices helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions. In this project, we:
- Analyze a car dataset
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
- Train machine learning models to predict car prices
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

The project is implemented using **Python** and popular **machine learning libraries**.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of cars, such as:
- Car name / Brand
- Year of manufacture
- Selling price
- Present price
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Seller type
- Transmission
- Number of owners

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed for model training.
